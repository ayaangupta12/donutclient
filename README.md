No seriously — this wasn't whipped up in five minutes. It took a ridiculous amount of time, effort, and probably a few brain cells. So show some love and toss a little credit this way. It's the respectful thing to do (and it makes me feel slightly more appreciated while crying into my keyboard at 2am).
